Mage university is my team's term project for our Game Design course. The idea was that we wanted to create a game with heavy lampshading and so had a story element. We also wanted a magic game with magic that you craft yourself. I invented this spellcrafting system but only got to populate it with limited spell effects as time ran out.

There are some technical glitches and bugs that we didn't have time to sort out. In the Unity Player, there aren't any problems with game lag, but with the built version there are problems, for example.

This is a simple and cheesy game but I actually enjoy playing it a bit.
