These are a selection of my favourite school projects at the University of Oregon. I chose these because they show many of the essential skills for a Software Engineer to have: technical knowledge, problem solving, documentation, coding style, and coding for non-behavioural qualities.

---Assembly Sort Algorithm---
This was the first and, sadly, only assembly assignment I had in my course. I absolutely love assembly programming and loved this assignment. I could excercise my knowledge of the processor and assembly in what amounts to a more complicated algorithm than what one would imagine in just coding in C.

---Disk Driver---
This was the final project for my Operating Systems class. It was the only project I got full marks on and it was because I spent the most time testing it and designing the architecture for, if you would call it that. It is a multithreaded program designed to simulate a disk device driver. It features some neat tricks as well.

---Kernal Imaging---
This was the big project in my Unix and C++ class. Having had a lot of experience with C++ beforehand, I spent a bit of extra time adding my own features to the project: cycle detection and a way to save processing time by checking if a filter needed to be rerun.

---Web Usage Monitor---
This was extra credit for my first class at the UO. I am proud of this project not because the project itself was hard, but because what I was lead to believe the project was was hard. Due to Notepad being faulty in reading the newline character, I was lead to believe I had to parse some rather difficult text files. I managed to produce a solution that worked completely, but I then found that the files were in fact line separated.
