This is a program that takes models from the Minecraft Builder (LUA) and turns them into 3D models. Included are two models. This program was written in C#.

To run: run "Modeliser for Minecraft.exe" in *\bin\Debug\. Select  the file you want to build in *\Model files\. The output files will be in whichever folder the executable is in, named "output.stl".

This was poorly written, made back before I knew about good programming practices. I wrote this because I had gotten a 3D printer and wanted to print out some of my structures in Minecraft.
