This is a Pi approximator, written in C++. This program approximates Pi by adding and subtracting all of the odd natural numbers. The expression for the series is: sum[(-1)^(n)/(1+2n)] where n is the iterator from 0 to infinity. The limit is proven to give Pi/4.

To run: Run *\Debug\Pi.exe and type in the maximum amount of iterations desired.

In hindsight, I think this program didn't work out that well. I created it to test out an algorithm I saw in a video.
