# Hack for a Cause 2018: https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/waste-prevention-by-internet-relay-food
This code was for Hack for a Cause 2018. My team was working to create a web and Android app to connect people with food to those who want and/or need food. The idea was that a lot of people produce a surplus of food which ends up going to waste. Instead of just throwing away food, if we could have people who don't have enough food take it, we would be solving two problems at once. That is what we tried to implement.

We produced a web app and an Android app as well as a database connecting all of them. With the app, you could post that you have food and see who posted that they had food. The web app also displayed a map showing where in Eugene the food was so you could pick it up. In our designs but not in the implementation was functionality to allow people to chat with each other, show pictures, and display notifications.

I wrote most of the Android code. Someone else was trying to help me but it didn't work out too well since she didn't know how to code for Android in Java. I ended up having to do most of the code in about 16 hours instead of the 40 or so we had, so the code isn't as good as it could have been. Despite this, it shows my attempt at using authentication and use of a RESTful API.
Our team was huge in this, being comprised of everyone who was trying this challenge. Therefore we automatically won the prize. If I had more time and more people helping me, the Android version of the app would probably look as good as the web app.

# CIS 422 Software Development final project: https://github.com/dvancleave/GroceryCartCalculator
This project was our second and final project for this course. We were tasked to show what we learned in software development tactics and try to create some kind of project. The project had to have multiple phases. 

Our project was an app that help the user budget their food. The idea was to maintain grocery lists for you and to estimate how much the food would cost. After buying the food, the app would ask for you to say what the real price was, updating its estimation scheme to better match the recent prices. A future goal was to scan a receipt to confirm prices and to allow people to pull recipes from the internet and add them to a grocery list.

No team did amazingly well on this project, but I am proud of certain aspects of what we did.

First, we improved on our organisation, which we cannot show since the website used to host our progress was deleted. I definitely appreciated when our architecture and design docs were well made and maintained.

Second, there is a feature that I implemented because our 'customer', my roommate, said it would be good to do. When editing the grocery list, having a button to delete items is a bit inconvenient since you can accidentally delete items. So, my roommate wanted to be able to slide the item over and hit a delete button, just like in iOS. Android doesn't support this kind of functionality normally, so I had to create the tech myself. Others have certainly done it before, but their API didn't do exactly what I wanted.
